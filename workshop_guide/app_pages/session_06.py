PROMPT_6_1 = """In Workspaces, create a Streamlit app called INSURANCE_DASHBOARD in INSURANCE_AI.OPS.

First, create a compute pool:
- Name: INSURANCE_COMPUTE_POOL
- Use the CPU_X64_S instance family
- Min and max nodes of 1

The app should use ONLY built-in Streamlit features (no external pip packages like plotly — use st.bar_chart, st.line_chart, st.metric, and st.dataframe instead). This avoids needing External Access Integrations which are restricted on trial accounts.
Use tables in INSURANCE_AI.OPS: POLICIES, CLAIMS, RISK_SCORES...

Build 2 pages:

PAGE 1 - Insurance Operations Dashboard:
- Row of KPI metrics: Total Premiums Written, Total Claims Paid, Overall Loss Ratio, Active Policies Count
- Bar chart showing premium revenue by policy type
- Line chart showing risk score trends over time by region
- Dataframe of top 10 claims by amount with status
- Use st.bar_chart and st.line_chart for visualizations (NOT plotly)
- Use st.metric for KPI cards
- Use st.dataframe for tables

PAGE 2 - Intelligence Chat:
- A chat interface using our INSURANCE_AGENT via SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.AGENT()
- Sidebar with summary stats from the data

Important:
- Use st.connection("snowflake") for the connection — do NOT use get_active_session()
- Do NOT include plotly or any external packages in dependencies
- Only use streamlit built-in chart types (st.bar_chart, st.line_chart, st.area_chart)
- Make it visually clean with st.columns for layout

Generate all the app code."""

Once Cortex Code has generated your app files in Workspaces:

1. **Run** — Click the **Run** button (▶️) in the top-right of the Workspaces editor to preview your app locally.

2. **Deploy** — When happy with the preview, click **Deploy** to publish the app to your Snowflake account so others with the appropriate role can access it.

Try modifying the app (add a chart, change KPI labels) and re-run to see changes live!

render_explanation("What this prompt does", """
Creates a Streamlit in Snowflake application using only built-in packages:

**Why no plotly/external packages?**
Trial accounts have restrictions on External Access Integrations (EAI), which are required for the container runtime to download pip packages from pypi.org. By using only Streamlit's built-in chart types (`st.bar_chart`, `st.line_chart`, `st.metric`, `st.dataframe`), the app works on both warehouse runtime and container runtime without any EAI configuration.

**Built-in chart alternatives**:
| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| `plotly.express.bar()` | `st.bar_chart(df, x=..., y=...)` |
| `plotly.express.line()` | `st.line_chart(df, x=..., y=...)` |
| `plotly.express.area()` | `st.area_chart(df, x=..., y=...)` |
| Custom tables | `st.dataframe(df)` with column_config |

**Connection pattern**:
```python
conn = st.connection("snowflake")
df = conn.query("SELECT * FROM ...")
st.dataframe(df)
```

This completes the workshop!
